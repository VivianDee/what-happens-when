Have you ever wondered what really happens when you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and press Enter? Let's take a simple step-by-step journey through this process:

Step 1: DNS Request 🌐
The journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. Your browser needs to convert the human-readable domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address. So it sends a query to a DNS resolver, which translates the domain name into Google's server IP address. 

Step 2: TCP/IP 🌐
Next, your browser establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to Google's server using the obtained IP address and sends a request. TCP is a transport layer protocol so it ensures the data sent to the server gets there safely and that the response from the server also gets to the browser safely.

Step 3: Firewall 🛡️
If the network has a firewall, the firewall inspects the request from your browser to Google's server, to make sure it's safe and within security rules.

Sidenote:  HTTPS/SSL🌐🔐

Google's website uses the HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol to ensure secure communication. So the data sent from your browser to Google's servers is encrypted.

The browser also checks Google's SSL certificate to confirm the authenticity of the connection.

Step 4: Load Balancer 🔄 🔄
The request from the browser gets to the load balancer first. You see, because of how big Google is, it receives a lot of requests so it uses load balancers to evenly distribute traffic across multiple servers, ensuring the website runs smoothly and efficiently.

Step 5: Web Server 🚀🔍
 Finally, Google's web servers handle your request, serving static content, dynamic web pages and handling different tasks. A websever software like Apache or Nginx makes this possible.

Extra information : Application Server 🚀💼

So now that the websevers has handled the request and  the Google website is displayed on your browser, performing a task like a Google search or user account login is handled by the application servers. 

Application servers manage the behind-the-scenes work. When you search for something, the application server queries the database to retrieve the relevant results.

A databases basically stores data in way that it can easily be retrieved, manipulated and updated. 

 What may have seemed like a simple action of typing a URL and hitting Enter is actually a series of steps working together🌐🚀 #WebDevelopment #InternetMagic#ALX
